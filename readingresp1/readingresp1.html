<h1>READING<br> RESPONSE <br><span class="h1bold">ONE</span></h1>

<p> <span class="numbers">1.</span> Designers uses the word “user” when developing products. Don Norman states that the word “user” is not the way to describe those who will use the product. He wishes to call them “people” as a reminder that they are human beings using technology.
<br><br>
Although the point of replacing users with the word “people” can help developers empathize problems and remove the idea of the computer, Liliana believes switching the words may be “dangerous”. The term “user” reminds us that we are in fact using a computer system created by developers. Removing that distinction would result in losing our opportunities to ask for better products. The product in the end is for the user, created by developers. It reminds us that it is an interactive relationship with a computer.

<br><br><span class="numbers">2.</span> Liliana's calls an ideal internet user: General Purpose User/Universal User. These users are able to use their technology and system to complete their goals in many ways without relying on specific apps. This allows them to challenge themselves and think of different ways to navigate through technology. <br>

<br><span class="numbers">3.</span>There are many gaps on an interface where the user must come in and complete a task provided by the system. Such as uploading files, filling in forms and confirmations. One gap I can recall is when an ad on Youtube is continually playing and the “Skip Ad” button appears, its the user’s choice to skip the ad or continue playing it.
