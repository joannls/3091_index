	<h1>READING <br>RESPONSE <br> <span class="h1bold">TWO</span></h1>
	<p><span class="numbers">1. </span>On a daily basis we use our devices and the browsers and features it comes with. We  know how to work around them by mindlessly executing gestures such as swiping, clicking, and scrolling to complete a task. Seu is asking the readers to defamiliarize with the device and the system it runs on and what she means by this is that she wants users to see these displays and interactions in a perspective where we disregard our exisiting knowledge on them. Doing this enables us to see them in a different light and are able to appreciate the art/design form and function. This can help us use these tools to potentially deliver a message, which in her words, ‘poetry’. By defamiliarizing, we can notice the design and contemplate on our gestures and why we behave the way we do when in contact with these systems. <br><br>

<span class="numbers">2.</span> Performing data is one of the six categories in poetic tools. This type of poetic tool uses data, compiles them to generate a visual and/or interactive piece that would communicate concepts or messages. Artists reassembling and visualizing the data creatively helps audiences read certain datas in a different way. One example I found is <a href="http://indirect.flights/">INDIRECT FLIGHTS</a> <br><br>

<p id="websiteinfo">- This website is a compilation of images from maps of different landscapes of the world in an aerial perspective. The way users interact with the site is that they scroll through and experience a loop of different, unique landscapes. The artist created this by arranging and editing the images, blending on top of each other as layers. The intent was to make a tactile, contemporary landscape by visualizing transportation using aerial landscape images.  The use of aerial images relates to the experience of travelling in real life, such as dealing with travel paths and in-flight experiences.</p>
