	<h1> READING<br>RESPONSE<br><span class="h1bold">THREE</span></h1>
	<p><span class="numbers">1.</span> Laurel Shwulst believes there is so much more to the web than the usual, popular social media platforms (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter) that are heavily used nowadays. She believes that these popular sites and applications is only a way for companies to advertise, seek/collect data, all for the growth of the company. When people stray away from the social applications, they seek for an outlet that can truly express what they do and who they are. Which makes her think about what it really means to create and publicize a website. Using metaphors, she describes the endless possibilities of creating a website and the behaviours it can undergo.<br><br>

I somewhat agree to her thoughts of big social media outlets. Yes, individually made websites reflects our style and creativity far more than company-made platforms. There is no limit in the way we design it visually and internally (navigation). However, I have a liking to the limitedness of social media websites. Everyone has the same design structure and rules to follow, everyone is equal and connected. Sometimes creativity can be seen within a structured form.<br><br>
